# DashOfMilk
A simple mod for Mindustry that adds tea - with milk.

## Importing

Simply download this repository as a zip, then import it through the `Mods` dialog in Mindustry. Or, unzip this repo inside Mindustry's `mods/` folder.

## Please Note:

Mindustry v5 could not handle multiple liquid inputs into a building, preventing this mode from being viable. While v6 might now allow this, I have not updated the mod, nor tested if this issue has been fixed.

Archiving this repo, pending further development.
